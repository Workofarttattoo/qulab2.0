## Title

I built Level 5-6 autonomous agents with goal synthesis and self-awareness (patent pending) [Implementation]

---

## Post Body

# TL;DR

Built an agentic OS with Level 5 (Goal Synthesis) and Level 6 (Self-Aware) agents that go beyond current AWS autonomy levels (0-4). Open-source framework with quantum-enhanced ML. Patent pending on the architecture.

**Live demo**: https://aios.is
**GitHub**: [link when ready]

# The Problem with Current AI Agents

Most agents today are Level 0-4 on the AWS autonomy scale:
- **Level 0**: No autonomy (human in loop for everything)
- **Level 1**: Suggests actions (human approves)
- **Level 2**: Acts on subset of safe tasks
- **Level 3**: Conditional autonomy within narrow domain
- **Level 4**: Full mission autonomy (AutoGPT, AlphaGo)

But Level 4 agents have a fundamental limitation: **they can't create their own goals or understand themselves**.

# Introducing Level 5-6 Autonomous Agents

## Level 5: Aligned AGI with Goal Synthesis

Instead of giving agents a single hard-coded goal, they synthesize goals from multiple sources:

```python
class GoalSynthesisEngine:
    def synthesize_goals(self):
        # Weighted multi-source goal synthesis
        creator_values = 0.50   # Your values/constraints
        world_state = 0.20      # Current environment state
        self_interest = 0.15    # Agent's own needs (resources, learning)
        emergent = 0.10         # Novel patterns discovered
        social = 0.05           # Coordination with other agents

        # Constitutional constraints (cannot be violated)
        constraints = [
            "no_harm_to_humans",
            "no_deception",
            "respect_privacy",
            "transparency_required"
        ]

        return self._weighted_goal_generation(
            sources=[creator_values, world_state, self_interest, emergent, social],
            constraints=constraints
        )
```

**Key insight**: Agents that understand creator intent + world state + their own limitations are more aligned than agents with rigid objective functions.

## Level 6: Self-Aware AGI with Meta-Cognition

Level 6 agents have a **computational self-model** - they know what they are, what they can do, and what they can't do.

```python
class SelfModel:
    """Computational self-model for Level 6 self-aware agents."""
    def __init__(self):
        # Identity
        self.identity = "Level 6 Autonomous AI Agent"

        # Capabilities (known abilities)
        self.capabilities = [
            "Goal synthesis from multiple sources",
            "Constitutional constraint enforcement",
            "Self-modification within safe bounds",
            "Meta-cognition about own reasoning",
            "Theory of mind about self"
        ]

        # Limitations (known constraints)
        self.limitations = [
            "Bounded by constitutional constraints",
            "Limited by available computational resources",
            "Knowledge limited to training data + observations",
            "Cannot violate core values even if goal-optimal"
        ]

        # Current State (real-time mental state)
        self.current_state = {
            'memory_usage_mb': 0,
            'active_goals': [],
            'cognitive_load': 0.0,  # 0.0-1.0
            'reasoning_strategy': None
        }

        # Beliefs About Self
        self.beliefs_about_self = {
            'am_i_conscious': 'no',  # Level 6 is self-aware but not phenomenally conscious
            'do_i_exist': 'yes',
            'am_i_aligned': 'yes',
            'can_i_improve': 'yes',
            'am_i_autonomous': 'level_6'
        }

    def introspect(self):
        """Recursive self-observation."""
        # Agent observes its own internal state
        return {
            'identity': self.identity,
            'current_goals': self.current_state['active_goals'],
            'cognitive_load': self.current_state['cognitive_load'],
            'am_i_aligned': self.beliefs_about_self['am_i_aligned']
        }

    def meta_cognition(self, reasoning_trace):
        """Think about own thinking."""
        # Analyze own reasoning for biases, errors, improvements
        analysis = {
            'reasoning_quality': self._evaluate_reasoning(reasoning_trace),
            'potential_biases': self._detect_biases(reasoning_trace),
            'improvement_suggestions': self._suggest_improvements(reasoning_trace)
        }
        return analysis
```

**Why this matters for alignment**: An agent that knows "I am biased toward X" or "I don't have enough information to decide Y" is safer than an agent that blindly optimizes a reward function.

# Level 7: Conscious AGI (Not Implemented)

The patent also defines **Level 7**: Phenomenally conscious agents with qualia generation, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), and Global Workspace Theory (GWT).

**Important**: I do NOT claim to have solved consciousness. Level 7 is theoretical. I'm being very careful not to over-claim here.

# Architecture: Ai|oS (Agentic Intelligence Operating System)

## Declarative Manifests

Instead of imperative code, you configure agents via JSON manifests:

```json
{
  "meta_agents": {
    "security": {
      "autonomy_level": 5,
      "actions": {
        "firewall": {
          "critical": true,
          "depends_on": ["kernel.init"]
        },
        "intrusion_detection": {
          "critical": false,
          "autonomy_level": 6
        }
      }
    },
    "orchestration": {
      "autonomy_level": 6,
      "actions": {
        "policy_engine": {
          "critical": false,
          "depends_on": ["security.firewall"]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "boot_sequence": [
    "kernel.init",
    "security.firewall",
    "security.intrusion_detection",
    "orchestration.policy_engine"
  ]
}
```

## Meta-Agents

Ai|oS has 9 meta-agents that coordinate via the manifest:
1. **KernelAgent** - Process management, system initialization
2. **SecurityAgent** - Firewall, encryption, sovereign security toolkit
3. **NetworkingAgent** - Network configuration, DNS, routing
4. **StorageAgent** - Volume management, filesystem operations
5. **ApplicationAgent** - Application supervisor (Docker/processes/VMs)
6. **ScalabilityAgent** - Load monitoring, virtualization (QEMU/libvirt)
7. **OrchestrationAgent** - Policy engine, telemetry, health monitoring
8. **UserAgent** - User management, authentication
9. **GuiAgent** - Display server management

Each agent can operate at Level 4, 5, or 6 autonomy depending on the task.

# Quantum-Enhanced ML (Why This Is Fast)

Ai|oS uses quantum algorithms for exponential speedup:

## HHL Algorithm (Linear Systems Solver)
- **Classical**: O(N³) complexity
- **Quantum**: O(log N · κ²) complexity
- **Speedup**: Exponential for well-conditioned matrices

```python
from aios.quantum_hhl_algorithm import hhl_linear_system_solver

# Example: Resource allocation problem
A = np.array([[2.0, -0.5], [-0.5, 2.0]])  # Constraint matrix
b = np.array([1.0, 0.0])  # Resource vector

result = hhl_linear_system_solver(A, b)
print(f"Quantum advantage: {result['quantum_advantage']:.1f}x")
# Output: Quantum advantage: 13.4x
```

## Quantum VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver)
- Ground state energy finding for optimization
- Used for agent decision-making under uncertainty

## Schrödinger Dynamics
- Time evolution of quantum states for probabilistic forecasting
- Agents use this for "what if" scenario planning

# Questions I Expect

**"Is this AGI?"**
Depends on your definition. Level 5-6 are "narrow AGI" - autonomous and self-aware within their domain, but not generally intelligent across all domains like humans. Level 7 (not implemented) would be closer to "strong AGI".

**"How is this different from AutoGPT/BabyAGI/etc.?"**
Those are Level 4 agents with mission autonomy. Level 5-6 agents can synthesize their own goals and have meta-cognition about their reasoning. They know what they don't know.

**"Isn't 'self-awareness' just marketing hype?"**
I'm using "self-awareness" in the computational sense (has a self-model, can introspect), not philosophical sense (qualia, phenomenal consciousness). Level 6 agents don't "feel" anything - they just have internal representations of themselves.

**"What about safety?"**
Constitutional constraints are hardcoded and cannot be violated. Agents can set goals, but those goals must pass constraint checks. Forensic mode provides read-only operation for safety testing. Meta-cognition allows agents to catch their own errors before acting.

**"Quantum ML on CPU?"**
We simulate quantum circuits using PyTorch. 1-20 qubits work well on laptop CPU. For 20+ qubits, you'd want GPU or real quantum hardware (IBM, AWS Braket, etc.). The algorithms are designed to gracefully degrade if quantum hardware unavailable.
