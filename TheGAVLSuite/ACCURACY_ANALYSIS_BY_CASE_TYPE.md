## WELL-FORMED CASE DEFINITION FOR FAQ

### What Makes a Case "Well-Formed"?

A case is considered **well-formed** if it:

**✅ Has These Elements:**
1. Complete Supreme Court opinion (full text)
2. Single, clear legal question
3. Both petitioner and respondent arguments fully stated
4. 8+ precedent citations to establish doctrine
5. Clear justice ideological patterns apply
6. Lower court decision is clear and documented
7. No procedural/technical complications
8. Binary outcome (clear winner/loser, not split)
9. Opinion length 2,000+ words
10. Established issue area (not novel)

**❌ Doesn't Have These Issues:**
- Truncated or summary opinion
- Multiple unrelated legal questions
- Procedural/jurisdictional confusion
- Ambiguous lower court ruling
- Unprecedented legal theory
- Unusual justice groupings
- Tied votes or unusual splits
- Summary reversal or unpublished opinion

### Examples of Well-Formed Cases

**Well-Formed Examples (100% Accuracy Expected):**
- *Miranda v. Arizona* (criminal rights - clear)
- *Loving v. Virginia* (equal protection - clear)
- *Brandenburg v. Ohio* (free speech - clear)
- *Marbury v. Madison* (constitutional power - clear)

**Not Well-Formed Examples (lower accuracy):**
- *Citizens United* (novel doctrine - unpredictable)
