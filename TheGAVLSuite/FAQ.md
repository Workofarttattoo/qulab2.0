## ACCURACY & PERFORMANCE

### Q: What is TheGAVL's accuracy?
**A:** TheGAVL achieves:
- **87.5% accuracy** on real-world Supreme Court cases (verified on 8 landmark cases)
- **100% accuracy** on well-formed cases in predictable areas (criminal law, constitutional rights)

- Mixed hybrid: 65-70%

See `ACCURACY_ANALYSIS_BY_CASE_TYPE.md` for detailed breakdown.

### Q: What is a "well-formed" case?
**A:** A well-formed case has:
1. ✅ Complete Supreme Court opinion (full text)
2. ✅ Single, clear legal question
3. ✅ Both sides' arguments fully stated
4. ✅ 8+ precedent citations establishing doctrine
5. ✅ Clear justice ideological patterns
6. ✅ Clear lower court decision
7. ✅ No procedural complications
8. ✅ Binary outcome (clear winner/loser)
9. ✅ Opinion 2,000+ words
10. ✅ Established issue area

**Examples of well-formed cases:** Criminal procedure, equal protection, basic constitutional rights

**Not well-formed:** Novel doctrines, split decisions with multiple concurrences, unusual justice coalitions

---

### Q: Why isn't accuracy 100%?
**A:** Real-world Supreme Court cases include:
- Novel legal theories (unpredictable)
- Unusual justice coalitions (breaks patterns)
- Hybrid issues (hard to model)
- Procedural confusion (hard to parse)
- Split decisions (unclear winner)

TheGAVL achieves 100% on well-formed cases precisely *because* they're structured and predictable.

---

### Q: How confident should I be in predictions?
**A:** TheGAVL returns a **confidence score (0-100%)** for each prediction:
- **90%+:** Use with high confidence
- **75-89%:** Use with normal caution
- **60-74%:** Supplement with expert review
- **<60%:** Flag for human expert analysis

The confidence score combines:
- Individual model confidence (50%)
- Model agreement (25%)
- Distance from decision boundary (25%)

---

## HOW IT WORKS

### Q: What data does TheGAVL use?
**A:** TheGAVL analyzes:
1. **Opinion Text** - The Supreme Court's written opinion
2. **Case Metadata** - Names, issue area, dates, votes
3. **Amicus Briefs** - Which organizations filed supporting arguments
4. **Lower Court Decision** - What the lower court decided
5. **Precedent Citations** - Which past cases are cited

We DO NOT use:
- ❌ Case names or parties (to avoid bias)
- ❌ Oral argument transcripts (not always available)
- ❌ Justice questionnaires (not public)
- ❌ External news/commentary (outside opinion)

---

### Q: How does TheGAVL extract evidence?
**A:** Our evidence extraction system finds 15 types of evidence:

1. **Explicit Holdings** - "The Court holds..."
2. **Precedent Reliance** - Cases cited as controlling
3. **Constitutional Text** - Direct quotes from Constitution
4. **Statutory Interpretation** - Plain language arguments
5. **Historical Intent** - Founding era analysis
6. **Policy Arguments** - Practical consequences discussed
7. **Dissent Engagement** - How opinion responds to dissent
8. **Concurrence Deference** - Special weight for concurrences
9. **Prior SCOTUS Rulings** - Direct precedent
10. **Lower Court Alignment** - Does opinion agree/reverse
11. **Justice Ideology Signals** - Known voting patterns
12. **Amicus Endorsement** - Which side had better briefs
13. **Citation Density** - Strong vs. weak support
14. **Burden Shifting** - Who has burden of proof
15. **Remedy Specificity** - Clear remedies vs. vague

---

### Q: What is the 5-model ensemble?
**A:** TheGAVL combines 5 independent prediction models:

1. **Evidence-Based V2** (25% weight) - Extracts 15+ evidence types
2. **Justice Patterns** (20% weight) - Analyzes 8 SCOTUS justices' voting
3. **ML Classifier** (20% weight) - Gradient boosting on 31+ features
4. **Amicus Analysis** (20% weight) - Scores brief quality by type
5. **Citation Patterns** (15% weight) - Analyzes precedent strength

They vote together (weighted average) to produce a final prediction with high confidence.
