- Well-framed examples:
  - "Revenue trend for Q4 2025"
  - "Customer acquisition cost changes over next 3 months"
  - "Website traffic growth trajectory"
- Transformation examples (Yes/No ‚Üí Trend):
  - ‚ùå "Should we hire more engineers?" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Engineering productivity trend with current team size"

  - Strategic: 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y

**Step 5: Understanding Results** üéì
- Interpretation guide for all metrics:
  - **Overall Trend:** Positive/Negative/Neutral
  - **Confidence Score:** 90%+ = Very reliable, 70-90% = Reliable, etc.
  - **Mean Prediction:** Most likely value, magnitude of change
  - **Uncertainty:** Range of possible outcomes
  - **Effective Samples:** Quality metric (450-500 excellent)
  - **Key Insights:** Auto-generated findings
- Decision-making guidelines:
  - High confidence (90%+): Safe to act

## Technical Details

### localStorage Implementation:
```javascript
// Check if wizard was seen
const wizardSeen = localStorage.getItem('bayesian_wizard_seen');
if (wizardSeen === 'true') {
    document.getElementById('wizard-overlay').classList.add('hidden');
}

// Save preference
function closeWizard() {
    document.getElementById('wizard-overlay').classList.add('hidden');
    localStorage.setItem('bayesian_wizard_seen', 'true');
}
```

### Step Navigation:
```javascript
// Update current step
currentWizardStep++;

// Hide all steps
document.querySelectorAll('.wizard-step').forEach(step => {
    step.classList.remove('active');
});

// Show current step
document.querySelector(`.wizard-step[data-step="${currentWizardStep}"]`)
    .classList.add('active');

// Update progress dots
document.querySelectorAll('.progress-dot').forEach((dot, index) => {
    if (index === currentWizardStep) {
        dot.classList.add('active');
    } else if (index < currentWizardStep) {
        dot.classList.add('completed');
    }
});
```

### Button State Management:
```javascript
// Disable previous on first step
prevBtn.disabled = currentWizardStep === 0;

// Change text on last step
if (currentWizardStep === totalWizardSteps - 1) {
    nextBtn.textContent = 'üöÄ Start Forecasting';
} else {
    nextBtn.textContent = 'Next ‚Üí';
