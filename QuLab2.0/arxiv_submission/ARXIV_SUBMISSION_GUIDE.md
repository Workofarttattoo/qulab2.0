## Step-by-Step Submission Instructions

### Step 1: Create arXiv Account

1. Go to https://arxiv.org/user/register
2. Create account with your email
3. Verify email address
4. Complete user profile with affiliation: "Corporation of Light"

### Step 2: Prepare Submission Package

**Location:** `/Users/noone/QuLab2.0/arxiv_submission/`

**Required Files:**
```
arxiv_submission/
├── paper.tex                    (Main document)
├── figures/                     (Optional - for figures)
│   ├── protocol_comparison.png
│   ├── fidelity_distance.png
│   ├── optimization_results.png
│   ├── scaling_analysis.png
│   └── hardware_roadmap.png
└── metadata.txt                 (Metadata file)
```

### Step 3: Convert to PDF (Optional but Recommended)

arXiv accepts .tex files, but you can generate PDF for preview:

```bash
cd /Users/noone/QuLab2.0/arxiv_submission
pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode paper.tex
pdflatex paper.tex  # Run twice for references
```

This generates `paper.pdf` for review before submission.

### Step 4: Create arXiv Metadata File

The `metadata.txt` file should contain:

```
Title: QuLab2.0: A Discovery Framework for Quantum Teleportation Protocol Optimization
Author: Joshua Hendricks Cole
Organization: Corporation of Light

Abstract: Quantum teleportation is a fundamental building block for long-distance quantum networks and the quantum internet. However, no unified framework exists for comparing protocols, optimizing parameters, and assessing hardware feasibility across different distances and physical constraints. We present QuLab2.0, a comprehensive open-source discovery framework that enables researchers and engineers to compare teleportation protocols, characterize quantum channels with realistic noise models, optimize protocol parameters using quantum-enhanced algorithms (Grover search, VQE, QAOA), assess hardware feasibility with detailed resource requirements, and analyze scaling properties across distance, qubit count, and fidelity requirements. Our framework is validated against current quantum hardware capabilities (October 2025) and provides actionable insights for building practical quantum teleportation systems.

Subject: Quantum Physics (quant-ph)

                    Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI)

Keywords: Quantum Teleportation, Protocol Optimization, Quantum Networks, Hardware-Aware Design, Quantum Resource Estimation, Quantum Repeaters
