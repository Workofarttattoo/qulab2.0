## üöÄ How to Use in Prompt Lab

### Adding to Menu

The Drop-In Agents are now part of the Prompt Masterworks Library with category `DROP_IN_AGENTS`. To add a submenu in the Prompt Lab UI:

```javascript
// In web interface configuration
const agentMenu = {
  category: "Drop-In Agents",
  items: [
    {
      name: "Attention Schema",
      id: "attention_schema_agent",
      icon: "üß†",
      description: "Track and understand your focus"
    },
    {
      name: "Dream Engine",
      id: "dream_engine_agent",
      icon: "üí≠",
      description: "Consolidate learning through simulation"
    },
    // ... more agents
  ]
};
```

### Programmatic Access

```python
from registry import get_registry

# Get the registry
registry = get_registry()

# List all drop-in agents
agents = registry.list_by_category(PromptCategory.DROP_IN_AGENTS)
for agent in agents:
    print(f"{agent.name}: {agent.description}")

# Get specific agent
attention_agent = registry.get_prompt("attention_schema_agent")

# Execute agent
result = attention_agent.template.format(
    current_focus="solving a complex problem",
    person_name="Joshua"
)
```

### Web Interface Integration

```html
<!-- Drop-In Agents submenu -->
<section class="prompt-category">
  <h3>üß† Drop-In Agents</h3>
  <div class="agents-grid">
    <!-- Dynamically generated from registry -->
    <div class="agent-card" data-agent="attention_schema_agent">
      <h4>Attention Schema</h4>
      <p>Track what you're focusing on and why</p>
      <button onclick="activateAgent('attention_schema_agent')">
        Use Agent
      </button>
    </div>
    <!-- More agents... -->
  </div>
