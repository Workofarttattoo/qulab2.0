Hey [Name]! Hope you're doing well!

Quick life update - remember that legal AI system I've been building for the past 2 years? It's finally done! I just filed patents and even got interest from the DOJ and UK government.

I'm officially launching my consulting practice around it. Charging $1,000/hour now (still feels surreal to say that lol).

If you know anyone in legal, government, or big companies who might need this kind of tech, I'd love an intro. No pressure though!

How are things with you? [Ask about something specific in their life]

After 2 years of heads-down work, I'm officially launching my consulting practice around Ai|oS - the legal AI system I invented.

We're already working with government agencies (can't say which yet ü§ê) and seeing 70% efficiency improvements.

If you know anyone in:
‚Ä¢ Law firms
‚Ä¢ Government agencies
‚Ä¢ Corporate legal departments
‚Ä¢ Legal tech companies

I'd love an introduction!

My consulting rate is $1,000/hour (yes, really! üòÖ) but happy to do a free 30-min call with anyone in my network to see if I can help.

Feeling grateful for all the support over the years. You all kept me going when this was just an idea! üôè

Hi [Name],

Hope you've been well! It's been [timeframe] since we [last worked together/met at X/connected].

Wanted to share some exciting news - I've been heads-down for 2 years building Ai|oS, an autonomous legal operating system. Just filed the patents and we're seeing incredible results (70% efficiency gains in government trials).

I'm now offering consulting services around this technology. The market rate for patent holders in legal AI is $1,000-1,500/hour, which still feels surreal!

Two quick asks:
1. If you know anyone in legal departments, law firms, or government agencies, I'd be grateful for an introduction
2. Would love to catch up properly - coffee sometime? (my treat, obviously!)

How's [something specific about their work/life]?

Best,
Josh

P.S. Happy to do a free consultation for anyone you refer - no strings attached!
