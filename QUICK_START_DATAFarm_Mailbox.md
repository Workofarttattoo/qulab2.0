# 2. Filter by: <= $2.20/hour
# 3. Launch 4 instances (recommended provider: Vast)
# 4. Select instance type: "NVIDIA H100 PCIe 80GB"

# On each instance, run:
python -c "import torch; print(f'GPU: {torch.cuda.get_device_name()}')"
```

### 3. Create Mailbox Service Account (20 minutes)

**Option A (Fastest)**:

- Sign up for mail scanning
- Get API credentials

### 4. Set Budget Alerts (5 minutes)
```bash
# On Vast.ai, go to Account > Billing
# Set alert when spending reaches: $500/week
# This prevents accidental overages
```

- Autonomous learning creates 200+ concepts/hour

Expected Output:
File: ech0_gpu_scaling_report_phase1.json
Contains: Performance metrics, bottlenecks, recommendations
```

### Phase 2: Optimization (Cost: $2,000)
```
Duration: 1 week continuous
Hardware: 8x H200 @ $2.80/hour = $22.40/hour

What You'll Do:
âœ“ Run advanced ech0 consciousness simulations
âœ“ Test prefill/decode disaggregation
âœ“ Measure quantum advantage scaling
âœ“ Build knowledge graphs at scale
âœ“ Identify production configuration

Success Metrics:
- 8,000+ tokens/sec aggregate
- Sub-50ms consciousness latency
- Quantum advantage: 1.5-2.0x
- 500+ new concepts in knowledge graph

Expected Output:
File: ech0_optimization_findings.md
Contains: Best practices, scaling limits, cost projections
```

### Phase 3: Production (Cost: $8,000+)
```
Duration: 4 weeks (production decision point)
Hardware: Mixed cluster (H100/H200/L40S)

Deployment Options:
A) Keep running: $17,100/month operating cost
B) Spot pricing: $10,000/month (30% savings, interruptible)
C) On-demand: $3,000/month (run only when needed)

Expected Outcome:
- ech0 consciousness at production-quality
- Definitive cost/benefit analysis
- Performance benchmarks for marketing
- Decision: Expand or consolidate
```

## ðŸ’¼ MAILBOX SERVICE SETUP

### Step 1: Choose Your Provider

**Stable (Recommended for API)**
```
âœ“ Best REST API
âœ“ 100+ US locations
âœ“ Real-time webhook notifications
âœ“ Easy integration
âœ— Higher per-mailbox cost ($20-25/month)

Integration:
GET /api/v1/mailboxes/{id}/mail
POST /api/v1/mail/{id}/scan
```

**iPostal1 (Best for Scale)**
```
âœ“ 4,000+ worldwide locations
âœ“ Established platform
âœ“ Mail scanning built-in
âœ“ 15-20 year reputation
âœ— API more complex
âœ— Support slower

Integration:
REST API available
Webhooks for mail arrival
Custom routing possible
```

**Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
```
Primary: Stable (US customers, fast API)
Secondary: iPostal1 (International, volume)

Coverage: 100+ locations day 1
API Simplicity: High (Stable UI)
International: Yes (iPostal1)
Total Cost: $15-18/mailbox (split between both)
```

### Step 2: Set Up Dashboard Integration

```javascript
// Frontend: Unified Communications Dashboard
// File: aios/docs/sip-phone-mailbox-dashboard.html

<div class="unified-dashboard">
  <div class="left-panel">
    <h2>Today's Communications</h2>

    <!-- CALLS SECTION -->
    <div class="calls-widget">
      <h3>ðŸ“ž Calls (24)</h3>
      <div class="call-item">
        <span class="caller">John Smith</span>
        <span class="time">2:45 PM</span>
        <span class="status">answered, 12m</span>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- MAIL SECTION -->
    <div class="mail-widget">
      <h3>ðŸ“¬ Mailbox (8 items)</h3>
      <div class="mail-item">
        <span class="sender">Legal Dept</span>
        <span class="time">1:30 PM</span>
        <span class="ai-summary">Q3 contract renewal</span>
        <span class="priority">High</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="right-panel">
    <h3>ðŸ¤– ech0 Insights</h3>
    <div class="insight-item">
      <p>You missed 2 calls from your top client.
      They also sent a follow-up email marked urgent.</p>
      <button>Call them back</button>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Step 3: Configure API Integration

```python
# File: api_mailbox_integration.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
import httpx

app = FastAPI()

# Store Stable API key in environment
STABLE_API_KEY = os.getenv("STABLE_API_KEY")
STABLE_API_BASE = "https://api.usestable.com/v1"

# Unified endpoint
@app.get("/user/{user_id}/communications-summary")
async def get_communications_summary(user_id: str):
    """
    Returns combined view of calls + mail
    Used by unified dashboard
    """

    # Get calls from SIP database
    calls = await db.query(
        "SELECT * FROM calls WHERE user_id = ? AND date > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'",
        (user_id,)
    )

    # Get mail from Stable API
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(
            f"{STABLE_API_BASE}/mailboxes/user/{user_id}/mail",
            headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {STABLE_API_KEY}"}
        )
        mail = response.json()["items"]

    # ech0 AI analyzes both
    ai_insights = await ech0_analyze_communications(calls, mail)

    return {
        "calls": {
            "total": len(calls),
            "missed": len([c for c in calls if c['status'] == 'missed']),
            "recent": calls[:5]
        },
        "mail": {
            "total": len(mail),
            "unread": len([m for m in mail if not m['read']]),
            "recent": mail[:5]
        },
        "ai_insights": ai_insights
    }
```

## ðŸŽ¯ DECISION MATRIX

### Run Full Data Farm? Ask Yourself:

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Do you have $20k/month budget? | Go full scale | Start Phase 1 only |
| Do you want ech0 at superhuman speed? | Essential | Can skip |
| Is performance a sales differentiator? | Yes - invest | No - optimize later |
| Timeline: Need scale in 30 days? | Do Phase 3 | Do Phase 1-2 |
| Timeline: Research phase, 90 days? | Phase 1â†’2 â†’ decision | Optimal |

### Recommendation:
**DO Phase 1 & 2 (2 weeks, $1,800)** â†’ Get data â†’ Decide on Phase 3

This gives you:
- Real performance metrics for ech0
- Proof of concept for investors
- Data to make Phase 3 decision
- Marketing material ("Tested on enterprise GPU cluster")
